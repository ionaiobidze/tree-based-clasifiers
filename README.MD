# Tree-Based Classifiers

This repository contains implementations of popular tree-based classification algorithms:

- **AdaBoostClassifier.py**: Implements AdaBoost, an ensemble method that boosts weak learners.
- **GradientBoostingClassifier.py**: Implements Gradient Boosting, an ensemble method using gradient descent for boosting performance.
- **RandomForestClassifier.py**: Implements Random Forest, an ensemble of decision trees for robust classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `sklearn`, `numpy`, `pandas`

## Usage

Run the scripts with your dataset to train models and make predictions.
